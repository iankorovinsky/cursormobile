# cursormobile

cursormobile is a mobile web application that ports Cursor IDE chat functionality to mobile devices, enabling developers to continue coding conversations on their phones away from their computers.

## Core Features
- Mobile-optimized chat interface mirroring Cursor's design
- Access to AI coding assistance on the go
- Synchronization with Cursor IDE chat sessions
- Responsive design prioritizing mobile usability
- Secure authentication via Auth0

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4
- Authentication: Auth0
- Target Platform: Mobile web browsers
- Payments: Stripe (subscription management)

## Stripe Payment Integration

The application includes a complete Stripe integration for subscription-based monetization. Here's how it works:

### Architecture
1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `StripeCheckout.tsx`: Modal component displaying subscription plans (Monthly/Annual)
   - Integrated into `ChatSidebar.tsx` with an "Upgrade to Pro" call-to-action
   - Success/Cancel pages for post-checkout user experience

2. **Backend API**:
   - `/api/create-checkout-session`: Next.js API route that creates Stripe Checkout sessions
   - Handles secure server-side communication with Stripe API
   - Returns session ID for frontend redirect

3. **Payment Flow**:
   - User clicks "Upgrade Now" in sidebar → Opens checkout modal
   - User selects plan (Monthly or Annual) → Triggers API call to create session
   - API creates Stripe Checkout session with price ID → Returns session ID
   - Frontend redirects user to Stripe hosted checkout page
   - After payment: Redirect to `/success` or `/cancel` page

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a Stripe account at https://stripe.com
2. Get API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
3. Create products and prices in Stripe Dashboard:
   - Monthly subscription (e.g., $20/month)
   - Annual subscription (e.g., $192/year)
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your keys:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your publishable key
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your secret key
   - Update price IDs in `StripeCheckout.tsx` to match your Stripe products

### Security Features
- Secret key stored server-side only (never exposed to client)
- API route validates requests before creating sessions
- Stripe handles all sensitive payment data (PCI compliant)
- Session-based checkout prevents price manipulation

### Pricing Plans
- **Monthly Plan**: $20/month - Unlimited AI conversations, Cursor sync, priority support
- **Annual Plan**: $192/year (20% savings) - All monthly features plus early access to new features

## Authentication (Auth0)

### Overview
cursormobile has Auth0 authentication scaffolding in place, ready for full implementation. Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution that provides authentication and authorization as a service.

### Current Implementation Status

The application includes basic Auth0 integration scaffolding:
- **Auth Button UI** (components/AuthButton.tsx): Login/logout button in sidebar
- **Auth API Routes** (app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts): Placeholder endpoints for Auth0 flow
- **Environment Configuration**: Template for Auth0 credentials

### How It Works

When fully configured with Auth0 credentials, the authentication flow will work as follows:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User clicks "Login" button in the sidebar
   - Redirected to Auth0's Universal Login page
   - After authentication, Auth0 redirects back to the app via callback
   - User session is established and user info is displayed

2. **Components**
   - **AuthButton** (components/AuthButton.tsx): Displays login/logout button, fetches user profile from `/api/auth/me`
   - **Auth API Routes** (app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts): Handles Auth0 OAuth flow
     - `/api/auth/login`: Initiates Auth0 login
     - `/api/auth/logout`: Clears session and logs out
     - `/api/auth/callback`: Handles OAuth callback and token exchange
     - `/api/auth/me`: Returns current user session

### Setup Instructions

To enable Auth0 authentication:

1. **Create Auth0 Application**
   - Sign up at [auth0.com](https://auth0.com)
   - Create a "Regular Web Application"
   - Note your Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
   ```env
   AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com
   AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
   AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   AUTH0_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
   AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Configure Auth0 Application Settings**
   In Auth0 Dashboard, set:
   - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
   - Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Implement Session Management** (Optional Enhancement)
   The current implementation includes basic OAuth redirects. For production:
   - Add session storage (cookies, database, or Redis)
   - Implement token exchange in `/api/auth/callback`
   - Add session validation middleware
   - Store user profile in session for `/api/auth/me` endpoint

### Security Considerations
- Environment variables should never be committed to version control
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement CSRF protection for state parameters
- Add proper session management with HTTP-only cookies
- Consider implementing refresh token rotation
