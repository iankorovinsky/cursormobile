# cursormobile

cursormobile is a mobile web application that ports Cursor IDE chat functionality to mobile devices, enabling developers to continue coding conversations on their phones away from their computers.

## Core Features
- Mobile-optimized chat interface mirroring Cursor's design
- Access to AI coding assistance on the go
- Synchronization with Cursor IDE chat sessions
- Responsive design prioritizing mobile usability

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- Target Platform: Mobile web browsers
- Payments: Stripe (subscription management)

## Stripe Payment Integration

The application includes a complete Stripe integration for subscription-based monetization. Here's how it works:

### Architecture
1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `StripeCheckout.tsx`: Modal component displaying subscription plans (Monthly/Annual)
   - Integrated into `ChatSidebar.tsx` with an "Upgrade to Pro" call-to-action
   - Success/Cancel pages for post-checkout user experience

2. **Backend API**:
   - `/api/create-checkout-session`: Next.js API route that creates Stripe Checkout sessions
   - Handles secure server-side communication with Stripe API
   - Returns session ID for frontend redirect

3. **Payment Flow**:
   - User clicks "Upgrade Now" in sidebar → Opens checkout modal
   - User selects plan (Monthly or Annual) → Triggers API call to create session
   - API creates Stripe Checkout session with price ID → Returns session ID
   - Frontend redirects user to Stripe hosted checkout page
   - After payment: Redirect to `/success` or `/cancel` page

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a Stripe account at https://stripe.com
2. Get API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
3. Create products and prices in Stripe Dashboard:
   - Monthly subscription (e.g., $20/month)
   - Annual subscription (e.g., $192/year)
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your keys:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your publishable key
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your secret key
   - Update price IDs in `StripeCheckout.tsx` to match your Stripe products

### Security Features
- Secret key stored server-side only (never exposed to client)
- API route validates requests before creating sessions
- Stripe handles all sensitive payment data (PCI compliant)
- Session-based checkout prevents price manipulation

### Pricing Plans
- **Monthly Plan**: $20/month - Unlimited AI conversations, Cursor sync, priority support
- **Annual Plan**: $192/year (20% savings) - All monthly features plus early access to new features
